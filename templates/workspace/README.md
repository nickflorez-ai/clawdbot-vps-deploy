# Your AI Collaborator Workspace

Welcome to your personal workspace with your AI Collaborator! This is your "home base" for working together.

## 🎯 What is this?

This repository is a safe, private space where you and your AI Collaborator work together. Think of it like a shared desk where:
- Your AI puts work for you to review
- You approve or request changes
- Everything is tracked and versioned

## 📁 Folder Structure

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `inbox/` | Your AI drops completed work here for your review |
| `drafts/` | Work in progress - things being developed |
| `approved/` | Work you've reviewed and approved |
| `decisions/` | Important decisions and their rationale |

## 🔄 How It Works

### 1. AI Creates Work
Your AI Collaborator will create documents, drafts, and deliverables. They'll either:
- Put files directly in `inbox/` for simple items
- Create a **Pull Request** for larger work that needs discussion

### 2. You Review
You'll get a notification when something needs your attention:
- **For files in inbox:** Review and move to `approved/` if good
- **For Pull Requests:** Review, comment, and approve when ready

### 3. Iterate Together
- Leave comments to request changes
- Your AI learns your preferences over time
- Ask questions anytime via Telegram

## ✅ Approving Work

### Option A: Simple Approval (for inbox items)
1. Review the file in `inbox/`
2. If approved, move it to `approved/`
3. If changes needed, tell your AI via Telegram

### Option B: Pull Request Approval (for larger work)
1. Click "Files changed" to see what's new
2. Leave comments on specific lines if needed
3. Click "Approve" when satisfied
4. Click "Merge" to finalize

## 💡 Tips

- **Be specific** when requesting work - the more detail, the better results
- **Use this space** for sensitive drafts you want version-controlled
- **Don't worry about breaking things** - everything is backed up and reversible
- **Ask your AI** to explain anything in this repo you don't understand

## 🔒 Privacy

This repository is **private**. Only you and your AI Collaborator have access. Feel free to use it for confidential work.
