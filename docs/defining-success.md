# How to Define Success for Your AI

*A guide on getting the most from your AI partner*

---

## The Key Insight

Your AI can work autonomously on tasks **while you focus on other things** — but only if you clearly define what success looks like.

Think of it like delegating to a highly capable team member who's new to the company: they need clear criteria to know when they've done a good job.

## The Problem with Vague Instructions

| What You Say | What AI Hears | Result |
|--------------|---------------|--------|
| "Make this better" | ??? | Guesswork, back-and-forth |
| "Clean up this report" | ??? | Multiple revisions needed |
| "Help me with this email" | ??? | You stay in the loop constantly |

**Vague instructions keep you in the loop.** You become the bottleneck.

## The Power of Verifiable Success Criteria

| What You Say | What AI Delivers | Result |
|--------------|------------------|--------|
| "Summary should be <200 words, include 3 key metrics with YoY comparison" | Exactly that | Done in one pass |
| "Email should be professional, acknowledge their concern, propose Thursday meeting, <100 words" | Exactly that | You review and send |
| "Find all Q4 deals over $1M, list by close date, flag any missing docs" | Exactly that | AI works while you do other things |

**Clear criteria = autonomous work.** You review the output, not manage the process.

## The SMART-V Framework

When giving your AI a task, include:

### **S**pecific
What exactly needs to be done?
- ❌ "Update the presentation"
- ✅ "Add Q4 revenue numbers to slide 7"

### **M**easurable
How will we know it's complete?
- ❌ "Make it comprehensive"
- ✅ "Include all 12 regional markets"

### **A**ctionable
What concrete steps are involved?
- ❌ "Improve our process"
- ✅ "Document the current 5-step approval workflow, identify bottlenecks, propose alternatives"

### **R**ealistic
Is this achievable with available information?
- ❌ "Predict next quarter's revenue" (requires data AI doesn't have)
- ✅ "Summarize last quarter's revenue trends from this report" (has the data)

### **T**ime-bound
When do you need it?
- ❌ "When you get a chance"
- ✅ "Before my 3pm meeting" or "By end of day"

### **V**erifiable (The Secret Ingredient)
How will YOU know it's right?
- ❌ "Make it good"
- ✅ "I'll check that all 5 required sections are present and numbers match the source data"

## Examples by Task Type

### Email Drafting
**Vague:** "Write a response to John's email"

**Verifiable:**
> "Draft a response to John's email about the Q4 budget:
> - Acknowledge his timeline concern
> - Agree to the Thursday meeting
> - Ask him to bring the revised projections
> - Professional but warm tone
> - Under 100 words"

### Report Review
**Vague:** "Check this report"

**Verifiable:**
> "Review this document for:
> - All required sections present
> - Numbers match source data
> - No spelling/grammar errors
> - Formatting consistent
> List anything missing or incorrect"

### Research Tasks
**Vague:** "Research our competitors"

**Verifiable:**
> "Find the top 5 competitors in our market:
> - Company name
> - Estimated revenue
> - Their primary product/service
> - Source for each data point"

### Meeting Prep
**Vague:** "Help me prepare for my meeting"

**Verifiable:**
> "For my 2pm meeting:
> - Summarize the 3 agenda items from the calendar invite
> - Pull relevant data from our last report
> - List any open issues
> - Draft 2 questions I should ask"

## The Handoff Pattern

For longer tasks, use this pattern:

### 1. Define Success Upfront
> "I need a first draft of the Q1 review presentation. Success means:
> - 10-12 slides
> - Covers: revenue, volume, margin, headcount, key wins, challenges, Q2 priorities
> - Each slide has 1 key message, 1 supporting visual
> - Executive-ready language"

### 2. Let AI Work
Your AI creates the draft while you handle other things.

### 3. Review Against Criteria
When you come back, check against your criteria:
- ✅ 11 slides — good
- ✅ All topics covered — good
- ⚠️ Slide 7 needs a better visual — specific feedback
- ✅ Language is clean — good

### 4. Provide Specific Feedback
> "Slide 7: replace the bullet list with a bar chart showing month-over-month volume"

### 5. AI Iterates
One more pass, then done.

## What Makes Criteria "Verifiable"?

Ask yourself: **"Could someone else check this without asking me?"**

| Not Verifiable | Verifiable |
|----------------|------------|
| "Good enough" | "Passes spell-check, all numbers have sources" |
| "Professional" | "No slang, complete sentences, includes greeting and signature" |
| "Comprehensive" | "Covers all 8 items from the checklist" |
| "Soon" | "By 5pm today" |
| "Better" | "Shorter than 500 words with same key points" |

## Your Domain Expertise Matters

You're the expert in your area. You know:
- What good output looks like
- When something is at risk
- How to spot a problematic pattern
- What questions stakeholders will ask

**Your job:** Translate that expertise into verifiable criteria.

**AI's job:** Execute against those criteria tirelessly.

This is the partnership that scales.

## Quick Start: Your First Verifiable Task

Try this today:

1. **Pick a routine task** you do often
2. **Write down what "done" looks like** — be specific
3. **Give it to your AI** with those success criteria
4. **Review the result** against your criteria
5. **Refine** the criteria for next time

Each iteration makes your AI more effective.

## Summary

| Old Way | New Way |
|---------|---------|
| Vague request → Multiple rounds → You're the bottleneck | Clear criteria → AI works → You review output |
| "Make this better" | "Success means X, Y, Z" |
| Constant back-and-forth | Autonomous work while you do other things |

**The better you define success, the more your AI can do for you.**
